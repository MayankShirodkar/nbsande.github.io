## Note
This porject is in hibernation now as I have put learning web development on hold to pursue python. I am aware that the page does not look great. I will get to improving the look of the page when i return to learning web technologies. In the meantime, contributions and PR's are welcome.

## Purpose
I want to get into web development and server architecture so I thought having a website to experiment on would be a good idea. This has the added bonus of getting an early start to having a portfolio page. This page will contain all my projects which I will be working on  and this README will have a short description of each project
